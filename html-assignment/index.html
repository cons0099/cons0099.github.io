        <!--Two paragraphs minimum 50 words.-->
        <p>Hello! My name is Makaya Constance. I am 20 years old and born and raised in Ottawa, Ontario since August
            4<sup>th</sup> 2004. I'm the youngest of two other brothers, one being 23 and the other 23. My personal
            interests include; cooking, finding new music/movies, and dabbling in a little furniture and interior design
            on Pinterest.</p>

        <p>Before I joined the Algonquin College family for <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>, I
            <em>really</em> didn't know what I wanted to do. If I'm being honest I still feel hesitant, but now I know
            I'm in something that can be used as a good base for design and alone is a successful field. If I had all
            the time in the world I would ideally do acting as well.</p>
